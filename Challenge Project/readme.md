# Week 1 Challenge Project
Hypothyroidism is a very serious, debilitating condition primarily caused by an underactive thyroid gland.

## Background
Doctors all around the world need our help to predict whether a patient has hypothyroidism. We maxed out our credit cards to collect pretty decent data on a variety of attributes for about 2800 patients--a good starting number, but a larger sample would be preferred. Moving forward, however, we simply cannot afford to spend so much money on data collection. Therefore, we also need to determine which attributes are the most meaningful to predictive models, and cut out the rest that don't contribute much.

## Goal
Achieve a very high sensitivity and specificity while using the least amount of features.

## Binary classifier (2)
Does the patient have hypothyroidism or not?

## Multiclass classifier (3 or 4)
Does the patient have hypothyroidism--and if he/she does, what type?

## Regression
Accurately predict the TSH levels of the patient with the other features

## Takeaway
I think this is will be a fun, interactive simulation to have students learn to balance the machine learning aspect with real-world (clinical/economical/ethical) considerations.

Thank you Tom for your suggestions!
