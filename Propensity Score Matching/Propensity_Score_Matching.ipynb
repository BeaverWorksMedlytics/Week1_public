        "\n",
        "In many medical studies attempting to find out if a particular treatment (tx) had an effect or not, it is not possible to randomly assign subjects into control and experimental groups. This is because generally these studies look at observational data (data over which the experimenter has no control). Properly controlled experimental data can sometimes be difficult to come by because randomly assigning subjects to control and experimental conditions is often unfeasable and/or unethical. \n",
        "\n",
        "This leaves us with observational data that is often biased. The group that receives the tx may tend to be younger, sicker, at an earlier or later stage in the disease, etc. In short, apparent differences in outcome between two groups may depend on characteristics that affected whether or not subjects in one group received a given tx instead of due to the effect of the tx per se. PSM attempts to reduce this bias by making the treated and control groups more comparable by matching subjects that are similar (or have a similar propensity for receiving tx) in each group. To do this matching, we can use the k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm (k-NNA).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will perform PSM on a depression tx dataset from a NIH study made publically available by UFHealth Biostatistics Open Learning Textbook (http://bolt.mph.ufl.edu/2012/08/02/learn-by-doing-exploring-a-dataset/). ***This dataset has been artificially biased for the purposes of this notebook, the original data has been altered.*** Once we unbias the data using PSM, the original result will be consistent with the results of the same analysis of the original data, but the actualy data will be slightly different. \n",

We match each patient in one group with its nearest neighbor in the other group based on some distance measurement that takes into account each potentially confounding variable we have data for. In our case, the variables of interest that may affect the probability of being in a given tx group are age, gender, hospital, and acuteT (Time is not of interest because this is a measurement from after the patients are placed in their tx groups). \n",

Nearest Neighbors is probably one of the fastest and easiest ways to do this. Since we're treating placebo vs. lithium and placebo vs. imipramine as two separate analyses, we will need perform two nearest neighbors matchings using only the probabilities relevant for each match (ex. when matching placebo and imipramine patients, use only the placebo and imipramine probabilities). \n",

This means that a variable that has no bearing on propensity score is weighted just as much as one that does.\n",
