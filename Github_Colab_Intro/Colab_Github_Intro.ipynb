        "\n",
        "Google Colaboratory (Colab) is an free online Python notebook that runs on a cpu or gpu in the cloud (i.e. some server at Google). If you have a google account, you can code with Colab without downloading any IDE (Integrated Development Environment [ex. Atom, Spyder, etc.]) or installing any packages onto your local machine. It is functionally very similar to Jupyter Notebooks with a few exceptions for uploading/downloading to/from local files.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some basics for working in Colab:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Add a cell of code or text by clicking \"+ CODE\" or \"+ TEXT\" in the top left corner\n",
        "* Move the cell you are currently editing up or down in the notebook's cell order by clicking \"*up arrow/down arrow* CELL\" next to the add code/text buttons. \n",
        "* Download your current notebook to your local drive using File > Download .ipynb \n",
        "* To run the cell that you are currently editing, use ctrl + enter. To run all cells in a notebook use Runtime > Run All\n",
        "* After you run a cell, its output (if there is any) will appear below the cell. To clear the output of a cell, click the three dots in the upper right corner of the cell and select Clear Output. To delete a cell select Delete Cell from the same menu.\n",

        "Colab has (limited) free GPU support. To enable GPU support use Edit > Notebook Settings > Hardware Accelerator > GPU. When switching between CPU and GPU, all your local variables will be cleared, so don't switch in the middle or running something unless you are prepared to reload all your local variables. Because the GPU is free and public, sometimes many people try to use it at the same time. This can result in you getting less GPU resources to work with. If you get a \"ResourcesExhausted\" error while using GPU, this means you have used all the GPU resources dedicated to your session and you will have to restart your runtime (Runtime > Restart Runtime). After restarting your runtime, your local variables will be wiped. You do not need GPU power unless you're doing something computationally intensive, like training a large neural network. My advice would be to not use the GPU unless you notice your runtime slowing down significantly or you know you will need it during your session. "
