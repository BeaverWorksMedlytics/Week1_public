# Week1_public

This repository is the PUBLIC repo for students of the 2018 MIT BWSI Medlytics course.  Most notebooks do not include solutions, and instead has [# Your code here] where students should write their own code.

This repository does not allow pushing so we recommend you fork this repository and work on your own copy.
